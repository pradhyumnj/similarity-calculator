58,What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming?,"Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism.",Abstraction and reusability.,4.5,1

The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding. Post-programming maintenance is also easier. Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle. Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.
